# Major Project Proposal

## Description
- I want to make a jetpack joyride game. Where the background of a character
moves while you move up and down. Sort of like flappy bird except the physics
of the player is different. I believe it has a very high potential of add ons
while the basic game is still simple. It has simple mechanics and obstacles
but the extras could make it even better; like a shop.

## Needs
- A player sprite with gravity
- Holding a key makes the player go up and releasing it makes the player fall
- Obstacles and background move toward the player
- Collision detection with obstacles
- Score that increases over distance/time

## Wants
- different kind of obstacles, like missiles or lasers
- Keep track of personal bests
- have the jetpack that is pushing the character kill wandering npcs
- maybe a shop and upgrades
- have powerups
- throw in different kinds of obstacles
- maybe a potential bossfight while trying to avoid obstacles
- score: points based on how far you have travelled
